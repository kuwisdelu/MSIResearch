		"sample processing" : "All the experiments were performed with a AP-SMALDI imaging source. The laser was focused by a centrally bored objective lens to a diameter of 5 to 10 micrometer. Controller software and hardware for the scanning procedure were developed in-house. The imaging source was attached to a linear ion trap/Fourier transform orbital trapping MS (LTQ Orbitrap Discovery, Thermo Scientific GmbH, Bremen, Germany) with a mass resolving power of 30 000 at m/z 400 in positive-ion mode. This setup offers atmospheric pressure compatibility, MSn capability, and sub-ppm mass accuracy. A UV laser with a repetition rate of 60 Hz (LTB MNL-106, LTB, Berlin, Germany) was used for desorption/ionization. The mass range was m/z 100-1000 for measurements of phospholipids. Tissue sections (20 micrometer thickness) were coated with DHB (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid) matrix using a pneumatic sprayer. Assignments of lipids were confirmed by MS/MS analysis directly from tissue (isolation window dm/z 3). All images were generated with a bin width of dm/z 0.01. Details of sample preparation, data acquisition and data processing are described in: Rompp, A., S. Guenther, Y. Schober, O. Schulz, Z. Takats, W. Kummer and B. Spengler (2010).

Selected ion images were generated using the software package MIRION developed at JLU Giessen. The imaging software imports raw data files as stored by the LTQ Orbitrap instrument software during image acquisition and couples this mass spectrometric information with additional scanning metadata, stored in separate data files by our ion source control program. This metadata includes the number of lines and columns of the image and the pixel size. The imaging software is able to create ion images from any of the detected mass-to-charge values with any selected mass window (bin width). A fast image browser of the MIRION software assists in selecting of images. In this work ion images of selected mass-to-charge values were created from the FT MS data set with a bin width of dm/z = 0.01. Up to three different ion images were overlayed in RGB images by the software to display different ion species in parallel. No other postprocessing steps such as interpolation or normalization to matrix signals were applied to the images.",

To remove the acid the glass slide was dipped in water for 2s to obtain optimal conditions for the trypsin application [40]. Trypsin (0.05 µg/µL in 10 mM NH4HCO3) was deposited with a home built spraying device. 15 cycles à 2 µL (flow rate 12 µL/min) for mouse brain and 15 cycles à 15 µL (flow rate 30 µL/min) for the whole mouse body were sprayed. Between spraying cycles the tissue section was placed for 10 min in a cell culture incubator (37°C, 100% relative humidity) and after the last spraying step it was incubated overnight.

All the tissues were gathered during dog sarcoma surgeries, snap-frozen and analysed later in the lab. The images were acquired on a MALDI LTQ orbitrap XL hybrid instrument.",
		"sample processing" : "After removal, the fresh biopsies were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. When possible, distant healthy tissues and tumor margins were sampled as well. The tissues were warmed up to -20 °C in a cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Nanterre, France) before preparation, and, using a metallic tissue cutting matrix (Ted Pella. Redding, California, USA) as a guide to obtain a neat surface, the tissues were cut into two halves and one was kept frozen in case further experiments would be needed. On the other half, a 1 mm thick slice was cut to be used for the SpiderMass analysis. The remaining tissue was cut at 10 µm with the cryotome. Two sections were deposited onto polylysine-coated slides by finger-thawing. One was used for Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) analysis while the other was stained with HPS and served as morphological control. This workflow was designed to ensure that the tissue used for MSI reflects the true composition of the tissue surface analyzed by SpiderMass and of the morphological control. For MALDI-MSI experiments, slides were taken out of storage, immediately dehydrated under vacuum at room temperature for 30 min, and scanned using a slide scanner (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). DHB matrix (20 mg/mL in 7:3 (v/v) MeOH/0.1% TFA in water) was manually sprayed using a syringe pump connected to an electrospray nebulizer operating at a 300 µL/h flow rate with compressed nitrogen flow pressure maintained at 1.1 bar. The nebulizer was moved uniformly throughout the entire tissue for 10 to 12 min according to tissue size. The homogeneity of the crystals was examined under a light microscope after spraying. The tissues were then analyzed using a MALDI LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an N2 laser (model MNL-100; LTB Lasertechnik, Berlin GmbH) which has a maximum repetition rate of 60 Hz. The maximum energy per pulse was set to 10 µJ and acquisition was performed in positive mode at 30,000 mass resolution (centered at m/z 400).

		"sample processing" : "Sample preparation for protease activity assessment by MALDI MSI For MALDI MSI analysis, frozen tissue was cut into 10 μm slices on a CM1950 cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany) at a temperature of -17 °C and thaw-mounted onto ITO-slides. In washing experiments, slices were rinsed with 2 x 1 mL 50 mM ammonium formiate (pH 7 and pH 3). The tissue was vacuum-dried for 15 min at 4 °C. To assess proteolytic in-situ activity, one “digest” slide and one “no digest” control slide were prepared per tissue type. For assessment of time-dependent endogenous protease activity on porcine tissue (5 time-points x 5 organs x 2 conditions, i.e. “digest” and “no digest” for a total of 50 MSI datasets), 4x1 μL protease inhibitor mix (PIM; 1x) consisting of 2 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), 0.3 μM aprotinin, 116 μM bestatin hydrochloride, 14 μM E-64, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 1 μM leupeptin was applied to each tissue. Additionally, 1x1 μL ddH2O was pipetted on each tissue as solvent control. For studies of inhibitor concentration-dependent protease activity on porcine tissue, a dilution series (0x, 0.1x, 0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 2.5x, 10x) of PIM was prepared in H2O, and one μl of each dilution was spotted onto tissue at arbitrarily chosen positions (n=2). Slides were kept on ice at all times. In experiments using mouse tumor samples, an additional tissue slice was covered with PIM, using the SunCollect (pump system, SunChrom, Friedrichsdorf) and the following conditions: 3x15 μL/min, Y-distance 25.5 mm, Speed in X= Low 4, Speed in Y=Medium 1. The final amount of PIM on tissue was 0.2 μL/mm2. After drying under vacuum for 3 min at room temperature (RT), porcine or mouse tissues on the “digest” slide (Fig. 1) were covered with the tracer protease substrate substance P (20 pmol/μL in ddH2O) using the SunCollect spray system as described for PIM above for a coating with 3.5 pmol/mm2 substance P. During the spray process, the slide was kept on a cool pad. After spraying, the slide was dried in desiccator for 3 min at RT. Both slides (“digest” and “no digest”) were incubated simultaneously at 37 °C and 95 % humidity in the SunDigest device (SunChrom) for 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 120 min or 360 min in time-course experiments and for 60 min in inhibitor-concentration-dependence experiments (porcine tissues). Mouse tissue was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C instead, as protease activity was apparently higher in snap-frozen mouse tissue than in slaughterhouse tissue, but otherwise treated as porcine tissue. Homogeneity of the substance P coating on “no digest” slides was evaluated, and experiment with inhomogeneous coatings were rejected. MALDI-TOF and MALDI-FT-ICR mass spectrometry imaging MALDI-TOF MSI with DHB matrix was performed as outlined(14). Porcine tissues were analyzed using an ultrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonik) in reflector positive mode and a mass range of m/z 500-2500. Tissues were measured at a lateral resolution of 200 μm, summing up 300 shots per pixel. External quadratic calibration using peptide standard II was performed for all MS instruments. Data was acquired and processed using flexControl V3.4 and flexImaging V4.1 software (Bruker Daltonik). For mouse samples, a rapifleX MALDI-TOF instrument (and flexImaging V5.1 (Bruker Daltonik) was used at a lateral resolution of 50 μm (20 μm for the replicate experiment), summing up 400 shots per pixel. After MALDI-TOF data acquisition, the same slides were analyzed using a 7T solariX XR MALDI FT-ICR (Bruker Daltonik). For imaging, the instrument was used in positive ion mode in an m/z range of m/z 100-3000 with a raster width of 20 μm and 15 laser shots/pixel. The following parameters were used: Ion transfer (Funnel 1 150 V, Skimmer 1 15 V, Funnel RF Amplitude 70 Vpp); Octopole (Frequency 5 MHz, RF Amplitude 350 Vpp); Collision Cell (RF Frequency 2 MHz, RF Amplitude 1200 Vpp); Transfer Optics (Time of Flight 1.5 ms, Frequency 4 MHz, FR Amplitude 350 Vpp); Quadrupole (Q1 Mass 350 m/z); Excitation Mode (Sweep Excitation, Sweep Step time 15 μs). Spectra of mouse tumor stomach were recorded using 512k (FID 0.2447 s) data point transient, corresponding to an estimated resolving power of 33,000 at m/z 400 resulting in a manageable data size of 22 GB. The average detected mass resolution at m/z 1347.73 was 23,000. Internal calibration was done using a lock mass of m/z 780.551 [PC(34:2)+Na]+. Data acquisition was performed using ftmsControl (Bruker Daltonik); ion images were obtained from flexImaging 4.1. For verification of substance P and its peptide products, CID fragmentation was used. Data analysis was performed using Biotools 3.2 and Sequence Editor 3.2 software (Bruker Daltonik).",
		"data processing" : "Processing of mass spectra and statistical analysis To export mean intensities, we manually drew regions-of-interest (ROI) on tissue around spots with inhibitor (+inhibitor) or without inhibitor (-inhibitor) on “digest”- and “no digest” control slides, respectively. Mean spectra of those ROIs were exported into mMass (V5.5.0(20)) for baseline-subtraction and peak picking (S/N > 5). Intensities of the m/zvalues of interest were exported into Excel (Microsoft). Non-linear regression analysis was performed in Prism 5.0 software (Graphpad Software). For statistical analysis of the mouse tumor tissue, TOF data sets were converted into imzML file format(21) using the flexImaging converter (resampled to 80,000 data points), while the centroided FT-ICR datasets were read directly by an in-house conversion tool. Subsequently, the datasets were imported into R 3.3.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)(22, 23) using MALDIquant and MALDIquantForeign packages(24). The segmentation was performed using spatially aware shrunken centroid clustering(25) (r=2,k=2,s=3) as implemented in Cardinal(26). The variable r=2 to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor. The segmentation was performed based on the m/z segment of 798.54 ± 5 and 798.54 ± 0.05 for the TOF and FT-ICR datasets, respectively. In that mass range, the lipid PC(34:1)+K+ with m/z 798.54, known to be enriched in gastric tumor in this mouse model, is present(14). No pre-processing was performed on the imported raw data. Intensities for Substance P and its peptide cleavage products were exported and grouped into tumorous- and non-tumorous segment.",

		"description" : "Using an experimental TBI rat model of mild/moderate Controlled Cortical Impact (CCI) injury, we combined large-scale proteomics identification and relative quantification using Spatially-Resolved Microproteomics with MALDI MS Imaging of Lipids. Spatially by studying different regions in the brain post injury in a coronal view, with main focus on the injury site itself. Temporally by studying the acute and subacute phase post injury, including injured rat brains at 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 10 days post injury. Direct on-tissue micro-digestion followed by micoextraction from 1 mm2 surface area within the injured cortical tissue were subjected to LC-MS & MS/MS analysis using HR MS. In addition, several identified potential biomarkers within our study were used to stimulate dorsal root ganglion (DRG), astrocyte, and macrophage cell lines to obtain a better understanding of their role and contribution in the injury.",
		"sample processing" : "Microproteomics: After subjecting tissue sections to several washing steps to deplete lipids, LysC trypsin was spotted on the injured cortical tissue using a piezoelectric microspotter chemical inkjet printer. Using Liquid Extraction Surface Analysis (LESA), the digested peptides within the injured cortical tissue were extracted. The extracted digests were then subjected to LC-MS/MS. Stimulated cell line proteomics: Protein extraction was performed on DRG, astrocyte, and macrophage cell lines using sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer (SDS). 50 µl of extraction buffer was added to each tube and samples were then heated for 15 min at 95 °C then sonicated for 15 min. After, a centrifugation step was performed at 16,000 g for 10 min at 20 °C. The supernatant containing the tryptic peptides, was collected and its total protein content was estimated using the Bradford quantification method. All sample concentrations were normalized to obtain a final concentration of 1.5 µg/µl per sample and further experimentation, including digestion, was carried out using filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) method with a mass cut-off threshold of 30 KDa. An alkylation step was performed in the dark by adding Iodoacetamide (IAA) solution and samples were then digested overnight at an incubation temperature of 37°C by adding LysC/trypsin. Desalting and enrichment of the samples was carried out using ZipTip C-18 (Millipore) just before processing using LC-MS/MS. LC-MS/MS analysis of both microproteomics and stimulated cell line extracts: MS analysis was performed using nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters) coupled to a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-electrospray ionization source. The peptides were separated using a reverse phase analytical column by applying a linear gradient of acetonitrile for 2 hours at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Full MS scans were performed with a resolution of 70,000 FWHM, a m/z mass range between 300-1600, an AGC of 3e6 ions and a maximum injection time of 120 ms. Data-dependent MS/MS scans were performed by subjecting the 10 most intense ionsto high energy collision dissociation (HCD). With regard to the MS/MS fragmentation parameters, the resolution was set at 17,500 FWHM, a m/z range between 200-2000, an AGC of 5e4 ions, and a maximum injection time of 60 ms. The isolation window was set at 4.0 m/z. MALDI MSI: After tissue sections were completely dried, DHB matrix was manually sprayed for 12 min onto the tissue using a nebulizer which was constructed in-house. Images were acquired using a MALDI LTQ Orbitrap XL operated using Xcalibur software version 2.0.7. The MALDI LTQ Orbitrap XL is equipped with a commercial N2 laser (LTB Laser Technik, Berlin, Germany) operating at λ = 337 nm with a maximum repetition rate of 60 Hz. Spectra were obtained in positive ion mode at a spectral mass resolution of 30000 (centered at m/z 200) in the mass range of 300−1000 Da. Each spectrum was acquired by averaging 10 scans with 1 microscan per step with a raster step size of 70 μm. External calibration in the normal mass range (m/z 150−2000) was performed before every acquired image using the ProteoMass MALDI calibration kit.",
		"data processing" : "Proteomic data processing: All raw data were analyzed by MaxQuant software version 1.5.8.3. Proteins were identified by comparing all raw spectra with a proteome reference database of Rattus norvegicus (Uniprot, release 20180712, 8027 entries for the cell line stimulated protein identifications, and release 20180302, 8022 entries for the on-tissue microproteomics identifications). The parameters chosen for the identification include: digestion enzyme used was trypsin LysC and maximum number of missed cleavages allowed was two. Oxidation of methionine and N-terminal protein acetylation were chosen as variable modifications. As for fixed modifications, carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set for the identification of proteins in the cell line stimulation case, and this modification was removed for the microproteomics approach. Proteins were identified based on a minimum of 2 peptides per protein, in which 1 was unique. As for initial mass tolerance, 6 ppm was selected for MS mode, and 20 ppm was set for fragmentation data with regard to MS/MS tolerance. The false discovery rate (FDR) was specified to 1% for both protein and peptide. The label-free quantification (LFQ) was performed by keeping the default parameters of MaxQuant. MALDI data processing: All images were converted to vendor-neutral *.imzML format using the plug-in available in ImageQuest software version 1.1.0 build S4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). SCiLS lab MVS software, version 2018b Premium 3D release 6.01.10194 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) was then used to process the uploaded vendor-neutral files. With this version of SCiLS Lab, the baseline removal option is not available, and the peaks are automatically imported. Normalization was performed based on the total ion count (TIC) method and m/z intervals were automatically set at ± 24.967 mDa.",

		"description" : "During aging, the kidney undergoes functional and physiological changes that are closely affiliated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There is increasing evidence supporting the role of lipid or lipid-derived mediators in the pathogenesis of CKD and other aging-related diseases. To understand the role of lipids in various metabolic processes during kidney aging, we conducted MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) analysis in kidneys harvested from young (2 months old, n=3) and old mice (24 months old, n=3). MALDI-IMS analysis showed an increase in ceramide level and a decrease in sphingomyelin (SM) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) levels in kidneys of old mice. The increased expression of cPLA2 and SMPD1 protein in aged kidney was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Our MALDI-IMS data showed the altered distribution of lipids in aged kidney as indicative of aging-related functional changes of the kidney. Combined analysis of MALDI-IMS and IHC confirmed lipidomic changes and expression levels of responsible enzymes as well as morphological changes.",

		"description" : "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder, accounting for up to 75 % of all dementia cases. Although the basis of AD etiology remains unknown, oxidative stress constitutes a major driver given its intimate association, specially at prodromic stages of the disease. In this line, Ubiquinol, the reduced form of coenzyme Q10, is a well-known neuroprotective antioxidant and has demonstrated significant effects in oxidative responses of β-Amyloid aggregation, internalization, and apoptosis-induced neurodegeneration. However, full extent of Ubiquinol effects in the context of AD is not yet known in detail. In this study, we designed a new methodology based on MALDI MSI for evaluating the peptide profile of the 3xTg-AD mice model fed a Ubiquinol-supplemented diet. By adopting functional analysis tools, we observed differential functional profile in hippocampus and cortex levels after 4- or 10-m o supplementation. Therefore, we also identified ACAD9, XPO1 and EIF3A as potential protein references for the diagnosis of AD at early/late stages.",

The m/z range for all samples was defined from 650 to 1800 because 80% of visualized peptides from these samples were in this range (data not shown). The following parameters were fixed as default for all samples: laser intensity at 3200, delay extraction set to 450 ns and the number of shots per pixel over the sample to 150. 20 first shots were discarded to avoid sample background noise. Deflectors parameters were adjusted for each sample to ensure a resolution (FWHW) >15000 at GluFib mass. Acquisition of MSI datasets was made using TOF/TOF Imaging Acquisition Software (ABSciex) in a fixed spatial resolution of 150 μm for all samples. Spectra data were loaded into the R statistical software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Cardinal MSI package was used for data processing. Reduction of data dimensionality was performed with a resampling method that consisted in a linear interpolation at m/z unit using the two closest m/z points at which intensities were measured. Basic tools from R programming language were used to obtain an average resampled spectrum of each ROI for subsequent classification and to perform, when indicated, a correlation analysis. Signal intensities were extracted and uploaded to MetaboAnalyst 4.0 (Chong et al. 2018) for statistical analysis. Datasets were previously filtered by Interquartile range (IQR) and, to make the assumptions fit better, data logarithmic transformation and auto-scaling were performed. Univariate analyses such as fold-change analysis and t-test were performed to compute summary level-statistics for each feature and individual study.

		"description" : "The spatial organisation of Cellular protein expression profiles within tissues determines cellular function and are key to understanding disease pathology. To define molecular phenotypes in the spatial context of tissue, there is a need for unbiased, quantitative technology capable of mapping proteomes within tissue structures. Here, we present a workflow for spatially resolved, quantitative proteomics of tissue that generates maps of protein expression across a tissue slice derived from a human atypical teratoid-rhabdoid tumour (AT/RT). We employ spatially-aware statistical methods that do not require prior knowledge of the fine tissue structure to detect proteins and pathways with varying spatial abundance patterns. We identified PYGL, ASPH and CD45 as spatial markers for tumour boundary and reveal immune response driven, spatially organized protein networks of the extracellular tumour matrix. Overall, this work informs on methods for spatially resolved deep proteo-phenotyping of tissue heterogeneity, which will push the boundaries of understanding tissue biology and pathology at the molecular level.",
